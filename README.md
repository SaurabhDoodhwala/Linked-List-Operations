# Linked-List-Operations

# I have used Visual Studio Code and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to write and compile my code. I made 2 C files named LLQueue.c and UnitTest.c, one h file named LLQueue.h  . 

# I have called all my functions in LLQueue.h file, implementation of functions (how they work) is done LLQueue.c file. Finally, in UnitTest.c file.

# I have made one makefile to compile the code.

# You need to call make in terminal, which will compile the C files into executable machine code. Then, you can just call ./UnitTest in terminal to check output of the test cases.

# After checking test cases, you can either press 1 to enter an interactive mode where you can check any function as per your wish. Else, you type 0 to exit.
